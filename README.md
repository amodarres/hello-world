# hello-world
My first repository
Goal would be to faciliate creating VR experiences for partners and developers; this product will be just an example of how this could be done. 
Future products: Mostly around content? what will be the business model? Eventually will be about more user data and owning the ecosystem. But what are the main elements driving this?
